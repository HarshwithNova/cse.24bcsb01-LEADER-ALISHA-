# 🌌 Cosmic Watch – Asteroid Tracking & Risk Visualization Platform

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets pass close to Earth on a regular basis.  
Although space agencies like NASA provide large volumes of asteroid-related data, this data is often **complex, technical, and difficult for the general public to interpret**.

There is a strong need for a **user-friendly, visual, and intuitive system** that can:
- Monitor near-Earth asteroids  
- Highlight potentially hazardous objects  
- Present space data in a clear and engaging manner  

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Cosmic Watch** is a **web-based asteroid monitoring and visualization platform** designed to transform raw asteroid data into **interactive visuals, clear risk indicators, and educational insights**.

Instead of overwhelming users with scientific numbers, Cosmic Watch focuses on:
- Visual clarity  
- Risk awareness  
- Smooth and immersive user experience
